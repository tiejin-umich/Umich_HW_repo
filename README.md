# Umich_HW_repo
This is a repository for what I have done in Umich. And in this repo, I will only add the courses I have graded which do not need that much code. Now, this repo have the following courses' homework:
1.2021Fall Stats 500 Stat learning I: Regression
2.2021Fall Stats 510 Prob Dist Theory
For other courses which have more codes such as 2021Fall Stats 507 Data Sci in Python, I create repo for their own.
